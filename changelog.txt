EF RPG API Changelog (Alpha 0.0.3)
  Date: 02/22/23

New Changes:
- Completed physics integration (Collider, hitbox for Tiled templates)

- Fixed a camera positioning bug where going off-map would cause repeated tiles
	 (using camera.update())
	 
- Removed the bitwise logic in the example camera-positioning code so that WASD can properly function.

- Implemented a new MapEntity loading algorithm (results have proven 2x as fast... 
	not sure how this will scale but it looks promising!)
	
- EFTiledMaps now reference a TextureAtlas when loading (much faster than loading individual texture files)
	This will alter the way maps will be parsed, so check the root/guides folder in the repo for a tutorial.
	
- EFTiledMaps now support animated MapEntities

- AssetManager: Added a 'quickLoad()' method, which forces an asset to load before continuing.

- Fixed a bug where moving the camera in fixed increments would cause stuttering on the opposite edge.
	(eg. moving camera right causes stuttering on left edge of screen, etc.)
	Fixed by calling camera.update() after moving camera.
	
- Created an intuitive input system. The EFAPI passes all input to the InputListener class, where InputHandlers
	take the input and perform functions. This input system allows for easy separation of game-based and UI-based input.
	See the 'GameInputHandler' class in the examples package for a possible application of this system.
	
Known Bugs:

- Not necessarily a bug, but the lights are a bit bright. Consider toning them down a few notches.

Plans for Alpha 0.0.4:
- Font Support
- UI Backend
- Support for Tiled templates with different properties
- Particle support (in-game and Tiled properties [ParticleGenerator])

Amazing work! You're doing great! I'm so proud of you :)
