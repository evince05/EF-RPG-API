Ideas for Future Releases (Brainstorming)

	InteractableComponent:
		-> A component that acts on input from the keyboard / mouse.
			- onKeyType(int key): runs code when certain key is typed (eg. 'E').
			- onLeftClick(): runs code when LMB clicks on the entity
			- onRightClick(): same as above, using RMB.
			- onMiddleClick(): same as above, using MMB.
			
Keep on working! It's coming together very nicely!!
