EF RPG API Changelog (Alpha 0.0.2)
  Date: 02/20/23

New Changes:
- Added map rendering (map backgrounds, templates, MapObjects, etc.)
- Created Tiled loading system for better template support:
	→ Lights can now be created in-game from Tiled templates
	→ Support for physics bodies (colliders, hitboxes), will be coming in a future version
- Miscellaneous utilities and stuff
- Bug fixes (probably? also probably created more bugs along the way)

Known Bugs:
- Camera cannot move right or down, and when it exceeds the map boundaries (left/up), it glitches (repeated tiles).

Plans for Alpha 0.0.3:
- Add Tiled/physics integration
- Create input system
- Add TextureAtlas functionality to existing maps
	→ Templates have an 'atlasPath' attribute, pointing to a .atlas file in the project
	→ Instead of loading individual textureregions, atlases will reduce this load time dramatically.
	
Keep up the great work!
